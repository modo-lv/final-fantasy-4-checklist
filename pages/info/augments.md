| Augment       | Give to         | Reason                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Auto Potion] | [Porom]         | Using up a [Potion] every time you are hit, regardless of damage amount, isn't very useful. Give it to [Porom] as one of the 3 augments needed to obtain [Dualcast].    |
| [Item Lore]   | [Palom]         | [Item Lore] is more useful than [Auto Potion], but still not as useful as [Dualcast]. Give it to [Palom] to make the most out of his [Flame Rod] and [Ice Rod] weapons. |
| [Counter]     | [Cecil]         | As the main character that is always in your party, and occasionally the only character, [Cecil] can get the most use out it.                                           |
| [Curse]       | [Palom] [Porom] | Very limited usefulness, give to [Palom] or [Porom] as the third augment for [Dualcast].                                                                                |
| [Tsunami]     | [Edge]          | Necessary for maximising [Rosa]'s and [Edge]'s stats on [NG+], and is more useful for [Edge] due to higher [Intellect].                                                 |
