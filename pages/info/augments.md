# [Augments](@) {#augments,augment}

:::{:columns}

## Description
Augments are the trickiest part of Final Fantasy IV gameplay mechanics. They serve multiple purposes, are of limited availability and their usage is irrevocable, which makes it difficult to experiment.
* An augment is an item that, when used, permanently teaches a character a new ability, which can then be equipped from the ability list in the main menu.
  * Only 5 abilities can be equipped at a time, including the auto-battle slot.
* Most augments can only be acquired once per playthrough, some can only be acquired once ever. Some can only be acquired or kept in the second playthrough.
* A lot of augments are acquired by "trading" with temporary characters (all except [Cecil], [Rosa], [Rydia], [Kain] and [Edge]) by giving them abilities while they are in your party. Each temporary character will provide one guaranteed augment when they leave, plus an additional one for each augment you used on that character, up to a maximum of 2 (3 total).
  * The only exception to this is [Palom] and [Porom]. They count as one character, but provide 3 extra augments (4 total), including the highly powerful [Dualcast]. You must give a total of three augments to them, at least one each. You also get *two* guaranteed [Twincast] augments from them.
* The secondary purpose of augments is to determine a character's stat growth at the highest levels. Stat growth is predetermined for each character up to level 70, but after that, each time you level up, the stats increase in accordance with what abilities the character has *equipped* (not just learned!). Combined with the fact that a lot of augments can only be acquired on the second playthrough, this makes fully maximizing characters' stats on the first playthrough impossible.
  * Only 4 of abilities can be equipped for stat growth, since auto-battle slot does not count.
  
## Stat maximizing {#stat_max}
Have these augments equipped at the appropriate levels on [NG+] to achieve the closest thing to maximised stats possible in the game, without sacrificing combat augments on less efficient characters (such as [Limit Break] on [Rydia] instead of [Kain] or [?????'s Love] on [Rosa] instead of [Cecil]). You can also use this guide for the first playthrough, although it won't be complete since you won't have access to all the augments.

##### [Cecil]\: 99/99/99/94/99
Level 70: [?????'s Love], [Gil Farmer], [Twincast], and [Cry].
##### [Edge]\: 99/99/99/99/99
Level 70: [Whirlwind], [Tsunami], [Ninjutsu], [Last Stand].
Level 76: Swap [Ninjutsu] with [Phoenix].
Level 79: Swap [Last Stand] with [Brace].
##### [Kain]\: 99/99/99/82/99
Level 70: [Limit Break], [Bluff], [Analyze] and [Jump].
Level 83: Swap [Analyze] with [Upgrade] and [Jump] with [Phoenix].
Level 98: Swap [Bluff] with [Jump].
##### [Rosa]\: 99/90/99/99/99
Level 70: [Whirlwind], [Tsunami], [Inferno], [Twincast].
##### [Rydia]\: 94/91/92/99/99
Level 70: [Inferno], [Dualcast], [Curse], [Gil Farmer].

## Recommendations

If an augment is not in the list, that means it isn't required for maximising stats and does not have an overwhelming advantage for some characters over others.

### New Game {#aug_rec_ng}

| Augment | Give to | Reason |
|-|-|-|
| [Auto Potion] | [Porom] | Using up a [Potion] every time you are hit, regardless of damage amount, isn't very useful. Give it to [Porom] as one of the 3 augments needed to obtain [Dualcast]. |
| [Item Lore] | [Palom] | [Item Lore] is more useful than [Auto Potion], but still not as useful as [Dualcast]. Give it to [Palom] to make the most out of his [Flame Rod] and [Ice Rod] weapons. |
| [Counter] | [Cecil] | As the main character that is always in your party, and occasionally the only character, [Cecil] can get the most use out of instantly retaliating against physical attacks. |
| [Curse] | [Palom] [Porom] | Good for maximizing stats, but very limited usefulness in combat. With [Counter] used by [Cecil], this is the only augment remaining to give as the third to [Palom] or [Porom] to get [Dualcast]. |
| [Tsunami] | [Edge] | Necessary for maximizing [Rosa]'s and [Edge]'s stats on [NG+], and is more useful in combat for [Edge] due to his higher [Intellect]. |
| [Bluff] [Cry] | [Tellah] | [Tellah]'s second extra augment is [Fast Talker], which halves the casting time of spells, making another exceedingly useful augment for magic users. |
| [Dualcast] | [Rosa] | Both mages benefit from double casting, but being able to recover and buff/debuff in a single turn is more useful than just doing damage twice. |
| [Twincast] | [Cecil] & [Rosa] | [Cecil] and [Rosa] [twincast] [Ultima], one of the most powerful non-summon spells in the game. |
| [Gil Farmer] | [Cecil] [Rydia] | Needed for maximizing [Cecil]'s and [Rydia]'s stats. More useful in game for [Cecil] as the main character who is always in the party. |
| [Fast Talker] | [Rosa] | While both mages will benefit from halved casting time, [Rosa] handles more diverse types of spells. |
| [Whirlwind] | [Edge] | Same as [Tsunami]. |
| [Draw Attacks] | [Cecil] | [Cecil] has the highest defense (including best armor) and is present in all fights. This makes him the best enemy target candidate, especially when combined with [Counter]. |
| [Reach] | [Edge] | [Edge] has the lowest physical defence of the main melee characters. |
| [Recall] | [Yang] | Recall is too expensive to use in random battles and too unpredicatble for boss encounters. Give it to [Yang] to exhange for [Kick] augment. |
| [Last Stand] | [Yang] | Doubling defense at critical HP is a very situational ability that rarely comes into play, while [Yang]'s [Brace] is something that can be strategically used. |
| [Focus] | [Edge] | [Edge] spends a lot of the playthrough lagging behind other melee characters in levels (and thus damage), and doubling the attack damage up to 3 times can help with that, especially in boss battles. |
| [Kick] | [Cecil] | Kick synergises well with [Counter] (put it in auto-battle slot) and [Cecil] spends most of the playthrough having the highest melee damage. |
| [Brace] | ? |  |
| [MP+50%] | [Rydia] | Both mages can use an increase in [MP], but [Rosa] can recover hers with [Pray] and [Rydia]'s summons cost more. |
| [Inferno] | [Rydia] | Needed by [Rosa] and [Rydia] for stat maxing, [Rosa] has more use of it due to higher [Intellect]. |
| [Darkness] | [Kain] | Goes well with [Jump] as a way to deal a lot of damage in a single attack (400% damage at the cost of 3 turns and 10% HP). |
| [Level Lust] | [Cecil] | Gaining levels quicker can be especially useful in the start of NG+. |
