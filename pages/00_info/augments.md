# [Augments](@) {#augments,augment}

:::{:columns}

## Description
Augments are the trickiest part of Final Fantasy IV gameplay mechanics. They serve multiple purposes, are of limited availability and their usage is irrevocable, which makes it difficult to experiment.
* An augment is an item that, when used, permanently teaches a character a new ability, which can then be equipped from the ability list in the main menu.
  * Only 5 abilities can be equipped at a time, including the auto-battle slot.
* Most augments can only be acquired once per playthrough, some can only be acquired once ever. Some can only be acquired or kept in the second playthrough.
* A lot of augments are acquired by "trading" with temporary characters (all except [Cecil], [Rosa], [Rydia], [Kain] and [Edge]) by giving them abilities while they are in your party. Each temporary character will provide one guaranteed augment when they leave, plus an additional one for each augment you used on that character, up to a maximum of 2 (3 total).
  * The only exception to this is [Palom] and [Porom]. They count as one character, but provide 3 extra augments (4 total), including the highly powerful [Dualcast]. You must give a total of three augments to them, at least one each. You also get *two* guaranteed [Twincast] augments from them.
* The secondary purpose of augments is to determine a character's stat growth at the highest levels. Stat growth is predetermined for each character up to level 70, but after that, each time you level up, the stats increase in accordance with what abilities the character has *equipped* (not just learned!). Combined with the fact that a lot of augments can only be acquired on the second playthrough, this makes fully maximizing characters' stats on the first playthrough impossible.
  * Only 4 of abilities can be equipped for stat growth, since auto-battle slot does not count.
  
## Stat maximizing {#stat_max}
Have these augments equipped at the appropriate levels on [NG+] to achieve the closest thing to maximised stats possible in the game, without sacrificing combat augments on less efficient characters (such as [Limit Break] on [Rydia] instead of [Kain] or [?????'s Love] on [Rosa] instead of [Cecil]). You can also use this guide for the first playthrough, although it won't be complete since you won't have access to all the augments.

##### [Cecil]\: 99/99/99/94/99
Level 70: [?????'s Love], [Gil Farmer], [Twincast], and [Cry].
##### [Edge]\: 99/99/99/99/99
Level 70: [Whirlwind], [Tsunami], [Ninjutsu], [Last Stand].
Level 76: Swap [Ninjutsu] with [Phoenix].
Level 79: Swap [Last Stand] with [Brace].
##### [Kain]\: 99/99/99/82/99
Level 70: [Limit Break], [Bluff], [Analyze] and [Jump].
Level 83: Swap [Analyze] with [Upgrade] and [Jump] with [Phoenix].
Level 98: Swap [Bluff] with [Jump].
##### [Rosa]\: 99/90/99/99/99
Level 70: [Whirlwind], [Tsunami], [Inferno], [Twincast].
##### [Rydia]\: 94/91/92/99/99
Level 70: [Inferno], [Dualcast], [Curse], [Gil Farmer].

## Recommendations

Augments in *italics* can only be acquired once, as opposed to regular augments that can be re-acquired on subsequent playthroughs.

### New Game {#aug_rec_ng}

| Augment | Give to | Reason |
|-|-|-|
| [Auto Potion] | [Porom] | Using up a [Potion] every time you are hit, regardless of damage amount, isn't very useful. Give it to [Porom] as one of the 3 augments needed to obtain [Dualcast]. |
| [Item Lore] | [Palom] | [Item Lore] is more useful than [Auto Potion], but still not as useful as [Dualcast]. Give it to [Palom] to make the most out of his [Flame Rod] and [Ice Rod] weapons. |
| [Counter] | [Cecil] | As the main character that is always in your party, and occasionally the only character, [Cecil] can get the most use out of instantly retaliating against physical attacks. |
| [Curse] | [Palom] [Porom] | With [Counter] used by [Cecil], this is the only augment remaining to give to [Palom] or [Porom] in exchange for [Dualcast]. |
| [Tsunami] | [Edge] | Necessary for maximizing [Rosa]'s and [Edge]'s stats on [NG+], and is more useful in combat for [Edge] due to his higher [Intellect]. |
| [Bluff] [Cry] | [Tellah] | [Tellah]'s second extra augment is [Fast Talker], which halves the casting time of spells, making another exceedingly useful augment for magic users. |
| [Dualcast] | [Rosa] | Both mages benefit from double casting, but being able to recover and buff/debuff in a single turn is more useful than just doing damage twice. |
| [Twincast] | [Cecil] & [Rosa] | [Cecil] and [Rosa] [twincast] [Ultima], one of the most powerful non-summon spells in the game. |
| [Gil Farmer] | [Cecil] [Rydia] | Needed for maximizing [Cecil]'s and [Rydia]'s stats. More useful for [Cecil] first as it can increase gil acquisition in early [NG+]. |
| [Bardsong] | [Edge] | While not useful in most encounters, can be strategically used for boss fights, as Edge's damage output is rarely notable, while [Hastemarch] stacks with regular [Haste] and [Life's Anthem] constantly regenerates HP for the whole party without using any MP. |
| [Recall] | [Yang] | Recall is too expensive to use in random battles and too unpredicatble for boss encounters. Give it to [Yang] to exhange for [Kick]. |
| [Last Stand] | [Yang] | Doubling defense at critical HP is a very situational ability that rarely comes into play. Give to [Yang] to exchange for [Brace]. |
| [Fast Talker] | [Rosa] | While both mages will benefit from halved casting time, [Rosa] handles more diverse types of spells. |
| [Whirlwind] | [Edge] | Same as [Tsunami]. |
| [Draw Attacks] | [Cecil] | [Cecil] has the highest defense (including best armor) and is present in all fights. This makes him the best enemy target candidate, especially when combined with [Counter]. |
| [Eye Gouge] | None | You'll probably acquire this quite late in the game, when it will be neither useful in combat nor good for trading. Save it to have an extra to trade in [NG+]. |
| [Reach] | [Edge] | [Edge] has the lowest physical defence of the main melee characters, so he can get the most use out of dealing full damage from the back row. |
| [MP+50%] | [Rydia] | Both mages can use an increase in [MP], but [Rosa] can recover hers with [Pray], and [Rydia]'s summons cost more. |
| [Analyze] | [Fusoya] | The same function can be achieved by using [Libra] spell and [Bestiary] item. Give to [Fusoya] in exchange for [Omnicasting]. |
| [Inferno] | [Rydia] | Needed by [Rosa] and [Rydia] for stat maxing, [Rosa] has more use of it due to higher [Intellect]. |
| [Darkness] | [Kain] | Doubling damage at the cost of 10% HP per attack goes well with [Jump] since it doubles damage again, making the total HP-to-damage "conversion" twice as efficient as attacking once per turn. |
| [Focus] | [Edge] | [Edge] spends a lot of the playthrough lagging behind other melee characters in levels (and thus damage), doubling the attack damage up to 3 times can help with that in some boss battles where it's important to deal as much damage as possible in a single attack. |
| [Kick] | [Cecil] | [Kick] synergises well with [Counter] (counter uses whatever is the first command in the list) and [Cecil] spends most of the playthrough having the highest melee damage. |
| [Brace] | [Cecil] | Using [Brace] as the auto-battle command together with [Counter], [Draw Attacks] (and, optionally, [Kick]) can make a lot of random battles easier. |
| [Level Lust] | [Fusoya] | While gaining 50% more [EXP] from battles can be useful to speed up early [NG+], this is also the least useful augment compared to others you can give to [Fusoya] in exchange for [Phoenix]. |
| [Piercing Magic] | [Rosa] | Barely any enemies use [Reflect], so give it to [Rosa] to be able to cast [Reflect] on the party and still heal/buff them. |
| [????'s Love] | [Cecil] | [Cecil] is the highest damage dealing melee character with regular attacks, increasing it further (+1 for each battle where [Cecil] [cover]ed someone, max. +99) can end up with him doing 9999 damage with every attack. Combined with things [Counter] and [Draw Attacks], most random encounters can get wiped in a single turn, even when the party is surprised or attacked from behind. |
| [HP+50%] | None | Unless you're really struggling with a boss and aren't willing to grind at all, I recommend saving this augment for [NG+]. |
| [Bless] | [Edge] | [Edge] has the highest speed of all characters and is usually less crucial in boss fights, allowing him to [bless] (and re-[bless], if necessary) the party without losing momentum. |
| [Omnicasting] | [Rosa] | While not useful in most random encounters, being able to cast things like [Haste] or [Reflect] on the whole party can make a lot of boss fights a lot easier. |
| [Phoenix] | [Kain] (or [Edge]) | When a character with [Phoenix] equipped is KO'd, he automatically revives all other KO'd characters by spending his remaining [MP]. The amount of [HP] the revived characters get depends on how much of the character's [MP] he has left (percentage), so give it to whoever uses the magic the least. I recommend [Kain] because he doesn't use [MP] at all, and has decent [HP] and defense, making him less likely to die first. |
| *[Safe Travel]* | [Cecil] | Being able to disable random encounters is most useful on the one character who is always in the party. |
| *[Treasure Hunter]* | [Cecil] | Doubling item drop rate is most useful on the one character who is in the party for all battles. |
| *[Limit Break]* | [Kain] | [Kain]'s second-highest melee damage, coupled with [Darkness], [Focus] and his [Jump] ability, allows him to reliably deal over 9999 damage in a single attack. |
