## [Namingway](@) {#namingway}
[Namingway] is a game-long side-quest that rewards you with [Safe Travels] [augment] upon completion. It involves meeting [Namingway] at each location where he appears and ocassionally doing something for him. It's possible to complete it on the first playthrough, although the lack of [Treasure Hunter] [augment] will make it take longer — at one point you need to give [Namingway] an item called [Rainbow Pudding], which can only be acquired as an extremley rare drop from flan type enemies — a 0.4% chance (0.8% with [Treasure Hunter] equipped).

There are two locations where you can reliably encounter the largest amount of flan type enemies:
* [Antlion's Den], B2 Alcove. One of the encounters there is 4 [Yellow Jellies](yellow_jelly), each of which has a chance to drop the pudding. The location is available early, but the encounter is rare. If you do it after visiting the [Moon] (presumably using [Siren]s, see below), the fight will be absolutely trivial — [Cecil] with [Kick] + [Counter] will end them as soon as they start. This is the fastest way, but will only gain you [Rainbow Pudding].
* [Lunar Subterrane], B5, the room just north of the southern exit. In this room, you can encounter [Flan Princess]es, which drop not only [Rainbow Pudding], but also [Pink Tails] (1.56% chance), which can be traded for [Adamant Armor] (strongest armor in the game) in [Adamant Isle Grotto].
  [Flan Princess]es pose more difficulty (and thus take more time per battle) than [Yellow Jellies](yellow_jelly), but there is an easy way to deal with them as well, if you have enough gil. Equip [Cecil] with [Crystal Mail] (immunity to [Berserk], found on the same level), [Counter] and put [Stardust] (an item that costs $4800, purchased at the item [shop] in [Tomra]) in his top command slot for both auto and non-auto battles. [Stardust] casts [Comet], which is powerful enough to kill all [Flan Princess]es in a single hit. So as long as you can afford to pay 4800 gil per battle, you can easily grind for both [Rainbow Pudding] *and* [Pink Tail]s.

You have two options on how to grind for it:
* Grind naturally, by running around the area until you encounter the enemies. Since both [Yellow Jellies] and [Flan Princesses] are the rarest of the encounters, this way can take massive amounts of time, but if you want to get the [Rainbow Pudding] before going to the [Moon], doing this in [Antlion's Den] this is the only way.
* Use [Siren]s. [Siren] is an item that summons the rarest encounter in the area, letting you avoid fighting all other enemies while you grind. You can buy them on the [Moon], in the [Hummingway Abode], for $3000 each.



## [Chocobo Forest](@) {#:id}
* Talking to a yellow chocobo lets you ride it on the world map, avoiding random encounters. It will leave when you get off.
* Talking to a white chocobo recovers [MP] for the whole party.
### [Fat Chocobo](@) {#:id}
* Using [Gysahl Greens] on the nest will summon a [Fat Chocobo], granting access to [Bestiary], [Event Theater] and [Music player] (unlocked by talking to [Namingway] at different points of the game).
